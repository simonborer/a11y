              <h2>Week 1</h2>
              <p>In our second week, we begin our discussion by considering a variety of definitions for 'end user'. This leads us to consider usability as a concept in code re-use (including for programmers with disabilities) and SEO. We examine the origins of the open web, disability rights, and subjectivity in field practice. We will also expand on types of usability testing, including analytics, surveys, individual, focus groups, contextual, first click, eye-tracking, and SUS.<br><br>Praxis will focus on accessibility auditing, and breaking down Steve Krug's test script.</p>
